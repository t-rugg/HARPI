 dwarf_legacy:0 "§YLegacy of Aul-Dwarov§W"
 dwarf_legacy1:0 "A Dwarven Empire"
 dwarf_legacy1_desc:0 "Aul-Dwarov was an empire by dwarves, for dwarves. Certain lesser races may be allowed residence in our holds, but they live in the shadows of the halls our ancestors built.\n"
 dwarf_legacy2:0 "Responsible Digging"
 dwarf_legacy2_desc:0 "Our ancestors left behind their holds, masterworks of subterranian construction and architecture. We must not disrespect them, but instead preserve their glory and splendour.\n—" 
 dwarf_legacy3:0 "Rulers of the Serpentspine" 
 dwarf_legacy3_desc:0 "Unfortunately, there are still a great many pests kicking around our ancestral mountains, and even some outsiders looking in, eyes set on the riches of our holds. We must be prepared to protect the legacy of our ancestors against these hostile incursions.\n—"
 dwarf_legacy4:0 "Back in the Fold"
 dwarf_legacy4_desc:0 "We are not the only dwarves in the Serpentspine. From remnant holds to bands of adventurers, many others have contributed towards the reclamation of Aul-Dwarov. They will surely be willing to join forces with us in the name of the glory of dwarfkind.\n"
 dwarf_legacy5:0 "Continue the Glory"
 dwarf_legacy5_desc:0 "Our ancestors left behind many great things for us, but we know we must build anew. The only way to truly do them justice is to accomplish architectural feats they never could have dreamed of.\n—"
 dwarf_legacy6:0 "From Amldihr to Grônstunad"
 dwarf_legacy6_desc:0 "The Dwarovrod carried goods and riches from one end of the Serpentspine to the other, perhaps the greatest trade network in the history of Halann. Our reclamation of Aul-Dwarov is not purely symbolic; we shall once again unite its economy through the Dwarovrod trade.\n—"
 dwarf_legacy7:0 "Hold Politics"
 dwarf_legacy7_desc:0 "Though we are one empire of dwarves, there are many different holds with their own rich cultures, traditions, and values. These holds together make up the new Aul-Dwarov, and we can learn a great many things from their diverse traditions.\n—"

 corin_legacy:0 "§YLegacy of Corin§W"
 corin_legacy1:0 "Escanni Chivalry"
 corin_legacy1_desc:0 "While more an adventurer than an aristocrat, Corin died to protect noble Escanni values from the encroaching Greentide. To righly honour her legacy, we must preserve the Escanni tradition of chivalric combat.\n—"
 corin_legacy2:0 "Martyr of Escann"
 corin_legacy2_desc:0 "Corin's triumph has taught us the value of a warrior's life — and that that value is best cashed in on the battlefield. Our soldiers know that, so long as they fight valiantly, their deaths on the battlefield inherit a fraction of the honour Corin claimed for us.\n—"
 corin_legacy3:0 "Corin's Circle"
 corin_legacy3_desc:0 "Humans, orcs and half-orcs, elves, dwarves, and even a gnome. Corin's party contained a diverse mix of soldiers, all unified under the banner of adventure. We should acknowledge talent and honour regardless of race or background.\n—"
 corin_legacy4:0 "Fields Soaked in Crimson"
 corin_legacy4_desc:0 "Many other societies have a selfish perspective of war; they prioritize their own survival and mourn their fallen. But we can celebrate battlefield deaths, just as we continue to celebrate Corin's, not for the death itself, but for the glory and victory they helped bring.\n—"
 corin_legacy5:0 "The Tenth Pantheonic Council"
 corin_legacy5_desc:0 "Dominic of Gallowspeak, one of Corin's closest allies, has advanced our understanding of Corin. She is not merely a mundane human warrior; no, Corin has inherited a divine status. When we fight in the name of Corin, we are continuing the Godswar on Halann."
 corin_legacy6:0 "Active Virtue"
 corin_legacy6_desc:0 "There were no cowards at the Battle of Castonath, and there will be no cowards in our armies. Resorting to cheap tactics and stratagems would be a disgrace on Corin's name. Even if our foes hide cower behind their castle walls, we shall face them head-on, as chivalrious warriors ought to do.\n—"
 corin_legacy7:0 "Beacons of Hope"
 corin_legacy7_desc:0 "Corin possessed an aura of hope, invigorating her allies against all odds. While most of our generals and adventurers could not hope to match Corin's abilities, they nonetheless attempt to capture some of this eminence, and spur our allies on to charge forth in the name of glory.\n—"

 reclamation1_desc:0 "Various foreign banks and merchants have decided to fund our valiant cause. Of course, we aren't fools; we know they have their own agendas and expect some return on their investment. Still, we should take advantage of these opportunities while they exist.\n—"
 reclamation2:0 "Resettlements"
 reclamation2_desc:0 "Perhaps one reason for the fall of the ancient empires is their refusal to properly develop their hinterlands. The dwarves stuck to the holds of Aul-Dwarov and the safe passages of the Dwarovrod, letting threats amass deep in the caverns; the precursors failed to fortify their entire land against magical threats and were blindsided by the Day of Ashen Skies. We shall not repeat these mistakes.\n—"
 reclamation3:0 "Battered, but not Beaten"
 reclamation3_desc:0 "Our spirit, and the knowledge of the glory of our cause, keeps us going even through the toughest circumstances. If our enemies expect us to fold over at the slightest opposition, they don't know what's coming for them!\n—"
 reclamation4:0 "Expelling the Occupiers"
 reclamation4_desc:0 "Unfortunately, all manner of intruders are actively squatting on our rightful land. This cannot stand. We will retake this territory, through force of arms if necessary.\n—"
 reclamation5:0 "Rally Under the Flags of Old"
 reclamation5_desc:0 "We beat the drums of our forefathers' marching tunes and bear the regalia of the greatest empire Halann has ever known. Who wouldn't want to fight for our noble cause?\n—"
 reclamation6:0 "Rebuild and Expand"
 reclamation6_desc:0 "Unlike those vagrants and intruders who had temporarily occupied our rightful land, we are worthy inheritors of the legacy we step into. Therefore, in addition to rebuilding what was lost, we must make new contributions to public life, to continue the spirit of our empire lost and found.\n—"
 reclamation7:0 "Cult of Ancients"
 reclamation7_desc:0 "When we look at the glory and splendour around us, and acknowledge our accomplishments in reclaiming this land, we know that we must have been helped along by fate and faith. By establishing a cult to our ancestors and forefounders, we can repay their blessings and continue their legacy.\n—"

 patronage5:0 "Magisterial Opulence"
 patronage5_desc:0 "Patronising the artistic class allows our ambassadors to wear the trendiest silks and our government buildings to be made of top-notch architecture. Such artistic displays demand respect in negotiations, and carries an implicit promise that working with us might allow others to share in our wealth.\n—\n§GUpgrades the §TPatronise the Intelligentsia§G decision§W, allowing you to purchase §GRelations§W."
 patronage6:0 "Disseminate Fine Art"
 patronage6_desc:0 "A healthy culture is a persuasive one. Soon, all our subjects will be wearing our mandilions and listening to our lute music!\n—"
 patronage7:0 "Patronal Politics"
 patronage7_desc:0 "By funding specific projects or interests of various ambassadors, statesmen, influential figures, and power brokers, we can get them to reciprocate by supporting the crown. As opposed to more blasé and corrupt forms of bribery, our investments have genuine cultural and humanitarian aims, that just so happen to cement our own influence in the process.\n—\n§GUpgrades the §TPatronise the Intelligentsia§G decision§W, allowing you to purchase §Gtemporary minor modifiers§W, such as Autonomy Reduction and Spy Network Construction Speed.\n§TPatronize the Intelligentsia§W can now be used §Yonce every 5 years§W."

 war_economy4_desc:0 "We would be remiss to focus on quantity at the expense of quality. Our investments in the arms industry will allow them to supply us with even better and more reliable firepower.\n—"

 war_economy6_desc:0 "Our production capabilities are not limited solely to off the battlefield. The construction of barricades and defensive measures before and during a battle allow us to greatly reduce the losses we suffer from enemy artillery.\n—"
 war_economy7:0 "Ammunition Assembly"
 war_economy7_desc:0 "Manufacturing artillery shells at scale is no easy task. We can simplify the process significantly by delegating different tasks to different sectors of a manufactory, effectively creating a proto-assembly line. Such measures have a noticeable effect on the efficiency and reliability of our production.\n—"

 militarist2_desc:0 "There is a significant intersection between our nobility and bureaucracy, and high-ranking officials in our military. If one didn't know better, they'd almost think our state is a puppet of our military! Placing such status on military accomplishments means many aristocrats are lining up to become generals and admirals, and we have become quite good at scouting talent cheaply.\n—"

 mixed_armies2_desc:0 "To bolster the size of our army, we ought to extend our recruitment to those of many diverse backgrounds.
