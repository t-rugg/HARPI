 dwarf_legacy1:0 "A Dwarven Empire"
 dwarf_legacy1_desc:0 "Aul-Dwarov was an empire by dwarves, for dwarves. Certain lesser races may be allowed residence in our holds, but they live in the shadows of the halls our ancestors built.\n"
 dwarf_legacy2:0 "Responsible Digging"
 dwarf_legacy2_desc:0 "Our ancestors left behind their holds, masterworks of subterranean construction and architecture. We must not disrespect them, but instead preserve their glory and splendour.\n—" 
 dwarf_legacy3:0 "Rulers of the Serpentspine" 
 dwarf_legacy3_desc:0 "Unfortunately, there are still a great many pests kicking around our ancestral mountains, and even some outsiders looking in, eyes set on the riches of our holds. We must be prepared to protect the legacy of our ancestors against these hostile incursions.\n—"
 dwarf_legacy4:0 "Back in the Fold"
 dwarf_legacy4_desc:0 "We are not the only dwarves in the Serpentspine. From remnant holds to bands of adventurers, many others have contributed towards the reclamation of Aul-Dwarov. They will surely be willing to join forces with us in the name of the glory of dwarfkind.\n"
 dwarf_legacy5:0 "Continue the Glory"
 dwarf_legacy5_desc:0 "Our ancestors left behind many great things for us, but we know we must build anew. The only way to truly do them justice is to accomplish architectural feats they never could have dreamed of.\n—"
 dwarf_legacy6:0 "From Amldihr to Grônstunad"
 dwarf_legacy6_desc:0 "The Dwarovrod carried goods and riches from one end of the Serpentspine to the other, perhaps the greatest trade network in the history of Halann. Our reclamation of Aul-Dwarov is not purely symbolic; we shall once again unite its economy through the Dwarovrod trade.\n—"
 dwarf_legacy7:0 "Hold Politics"
 dwarf_legacy7_desc:0 "Though we are one empire of dwarves, there are many different holds with their own rich cultures, traditions, and values. These holds together make up the new Aul-Dwarov, and we can learn a great many things from their diverse traditions.\n—"

 corin_legacy1:0 "Escanni Chivalry"
 corin_legacy1_desc:0 "While more an adventurer than an aristocrat, Corin died to protect noble Escanni values from the encroaching Greentide. To righly honour her legacy, we must preserve the Escanni tradition of chivalric combat.\n—"
 corin_legacy2:0 "Martyr of Escann"
 corin_legacy2_desc:0 "Corin's triumph has taught us the value of a warrior's life — and that that value is best cashed in on the battlefield. Our soldiers know that, so long as they fight valiantly, their deaths on the battlefield inherit a fraction of the honour Corin claimed for us.\n—"
 corin_legacy3:0 "Corin's Circle"
 corin_legacy3_desc:0 "Humans, orcs and half-orcs, elves, dwarves, and even a gnome. Corin's party contained a diverse mix of soldiers, all unified under the banner of adventure. We should acknowledge talent and honour regardless of race or background.\n—"
 corin_legacy4:0 "Fields Soaked in Crimson"
 corin_legacy4_desc:0 "Many other societies have a selfish perspective of war; they prioritize their own survival and mourn their fallen. But we can celebrate battlefield deaths, just as we continue to celebrate Corin's, not for the death itself, but for the glory and victory they helped bring.\n—"
 corin_legacy5:0 "The Tenth Pantheonic Council"
 corin_legacy5_desc:0 "Dominic of Gallowspeak, one of Corin's closest allies, has advanced our understanding of Corin. She is not merely a mundane human warrior; no, Corin has inherited a divine status. When we fight in the name of Corin, we are continuing the Godswar on Halann."
 corin_legacy6:0 "Active Virtue"
 corin_legacy6_desc:0 "There were no cowards at the Battle of Castonath, and there will be no cowards in our armies. Resorting to cheap tactics and stratagems would be a disgrace on Corin's name. Even if our foes hide cower behind their castle walls, we shall face them head-on, as chivalrious warriors ought to do.\n—"
 corin_legacy7:0 "Beacons of Hope"
 corin_legacy7_desc:0 "Corin possessed an aura of hope, invigorating her allies against all odds. While most of our generals and adventurers could not hope to match Corin's abilities, they nonetheless attempt to capture some of this eminence, and spur our allies on to charge forth in the name of glory.\n—"

 reclamation2:0 "Resettlements"
 reclamation2_desc:0 "Perhaps one reason for the fall of the ancient empires is their refusal to properly develop their hinterlands. The dwarves stuck to the holds of Aul-Dwarov and the safe passages of the Dwarovrod, letting threats amass deep in the caverns; the precursors failed to fortify their entire land against magical threats and were blindsided by the Day of Ashen Skies. We shall not repeat these mistakes.\n—"

 reclamation6_desc:0 "Unlike those vagrants and intruders who had temporarily occupied our rightful land, we are worthy inheritors of the legacy we step into. Therefore, in addition to rebuilding what was lost, we must make new contributions to public life, to continue the spirit of our empire lost and found.\n—"
 reclamation7:0 "Cult of Ancients"
 reclamation7_desc:0 "When we look at the glory and splendour around us, and acknowledge our accomplishments in reclaiming this land, we know that we must have been helped along by fate and faith.
