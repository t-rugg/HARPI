# HARPI â€” Holistic Anbennar Roleplay Ideas 

*An idea group submod built from the ground up for Anbennar.*

## Introduction

HARPI is an idea group submod for Anbennar. It is currently heavily WIP and is missing:

* Most art
* Some localization
* Some policies
* Non-vanilla idea group events

As development continues, this section will be updated to contain information on the mod. Once this mod is in a more complete state, it will be uploaded to the Steam Workshop.

## Design Principles

HARPI's idea groups were designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Idea groups are an opportunity for player choice and expression.**
    * From a theming perspective, idea groups should ideally represent aspects of a "strategy", "worldview", or "philosophy".
        * Idea groups should communicate HOW they achieve their goals as well as what their goals are. 
    * Certain races, strategies, and geographic locations will naturally have "must-pick" groups, but ideally these should be limited in number and make RP sense. 
        * It makes sense for Infrastructure ideas to be a must-pick for Dwarves. It does not make sense for Infrastructure ideas to be a must-pick for Orcs.
2. **Specialist groups are preferable to generalist groups.**
    * A player should have a clear goal or objective in mind whenever they take an idea group. We should avoid situations where an idea group is taken just because it is "strong" or "meta" rather than to achieve a specific objective.
    * Idea groups should have clear flavour identities that are reflected in their bonuses.
        * Vague themings like "Diplomatic ideas" are less preferrable to specific themings like "Influence", "Espionage", or "Dynastic", where possible. If these themings must exist, they should have a clearly-defined gameplay pattern rather than being generalist groups.
3. **Giving more choices is generally a good thing, but must be balanced around.**
    * As with most other idea group mods, a tag can take 16 idea groups at a 33% Admin-Dip-Mil ratio, for reduced cost relative to vanilla.
        * Since more idea groups can be taken for a lower cost each, individual groups must be weaker.
        * However, to allow for player expression, idea groups should still be allowed to have certain things they're particularly 'good' at.
        * Therefore, the priority is to make idea groups narrower in scope. A HARPI group should be good at a "smaller" amount of things than a Vanilla idea group is, allowing it to have a more focused theme and making it easier to balance.
    * Effectively, the player is given MORE decisions, but each decision is individually less impactful. While the total sum of their decisions should be roughly the same power level, the player has more minute say over the results.
4. **Modifiers can be fun and enjoyable to stack. However, stacking certain modifiers should require a large commitment.**
    * Some modifiers need to be stacked to a high level to even be worth considering, such as Culture Conversion Cost.
    * It is important that stacking one modifier doesn't force a certain selection of ideas to become "the meta". For example, if you plan on playing a blobby game, you shouldn't just be picking every single idea group that offers Core Creation Cost.
5. **There should be internal variety within the three categories of idea groups (Admin/Diplo/Military).**
    * In both Vanilla and many idea group mods, military ideas are ALL focused on JUST making you better at combat, and maybe offering a token amount of Prestige or something.
        * It is, of course, important that military groups all increase your combat prowess in SOME way. However, they should also provide some additional bonuses that feel small, but significant enough to set them apart.
        * Individual EU4 fights are not deep or engaging enough to offer a massive difference in "feel" between military idea groups based on blow-for-blow combat performance alone. Instead, the main difference in military idea groups comes from the "strategic feel" of these groups. This aspect should be promoted where possible: Defensive ideas should be less good at generic combat (i.e. much less Morale) and better at purely defensive gameplay.
        * In cases where it's difficult to distinguish the "feel" of military idea groups from each other through how they perform militarily, they should be distinguished through the other bonuses they provide.
    * One of the things that best sets idea groups apart is immediately giving players a new option to make a decision about.
        * For example, giving the player an extra Missionary, Diplomat, or Merchant lets them immediately feel the power spike of their choice.
        * Meanwhile, while an idea like Prestige from Land Battles can actually have a decent impact, it "feels" less impactful since it's so far removed from its effects (you need to get into lots of combat before the Prestige makes a difference, and then Prestige itself gives you very small modifiers that add up over time...)

## Attributions

Most of the mod was built from the ground up for Anbennar. Some UI elements were adapted from [The Idea Variation](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604203692) and [Homebrew](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2696955589), and some inspiration may have been taken from these projects at points. However, all idea groups, content, and design principles were purpose-built for HARPI. Idea group art was generated via Stable Diffusion using [Dreamshaper 8](https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper), but I would like to replace this with hand-drawn art in the future if feasible.
